# Undergraduate Math/Physics Notes
This repository contains the LaTeX markup for (and generated PDF files of) some study guides, presentations, and reports for undergraduate mathematics and physics classes. Some highlights include my notes on Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, Unique Factorization, and Galois Theory. Many proofs in my Number Theory class are comprehensive and fun.

Disclosure: these documents may contain typos, and in some cases the study guides are incomplete.

Typesetting for math and many of the sciences is typically done with a tool called [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). The markup language is slightly archaic, but powerful. Use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or set up a local LaTeX environment to generate the output PDF files.
